The Ganil2Root package is in charge of converting raw data at the GANIL format 
to raw data in ROOT format based on user specific classes. This package relies
heavily on the GRU (GANIL Root Utilies) package developped by L. Legeard at 
GANIL.

The detailed structure of the Ganil2Root package is:
Ganil2Root / libs
           / examples
           / scripts
           / Misc
           / README

1) libs
   This directory contains a class for each detector as well as the TDetector.{h,cxx} 
   Abstract Base Class. Each detector class should derive from TDetector. Each 
   class is in charge of defining the name of the parameters defined in the 
   ACTION file in the GANIL acquisition system. Then a user ROOT data class is
   filled with the data.

2) examples
   In this directory, examples of how to convert single or multiple runs at
   the same time are given. Examples are also given for the online analysis.

3) scripts
   This directory contains the Ganil2Root.C file which should be sourced in your
   rootlogon.C file.

4) Misc
   This directory contains examples of configuration files defining environment
   variables as well as a typical rootlogon.C file for ROOT.

5) README
   This directory contains general informations about the package (installation,
   how it works, ....)
